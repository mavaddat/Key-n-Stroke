## Donations and Financial

You can donate via [paypal.me/phaiax](https://www.paypal.me/phaiax), send Bitcoins (`1JWER55pheUeJzaUcqaYwP8ZaGe5C16Rp9`) or Stellar Lumens (`phaiax*keybase.io`).  You can verify the wallet addresses cryptographically on [keybase.io/phaiax](https://keybase.io/phaiax). Add the message "pkfs" or "keynstroke" to the payment so I can associate it with this project. After funds are raised for the six-years worth of developer certificates (which I assume will never happen), I will use any additional funds to buy üç¶ for myself and anyone I like.

This app shows a smart screen warning. To remove this, I bought a validated security certificate from [Certum](http://www.certum.eu/certum/cert,offer_en_open_source_cs.xml). Unfortunately, even this step did not remove the warning. (As reported by people on the internet). However, at least it now shows my name as the author.

I said that if someone funds at least three years of certification (‚Ç¨ 75.00), I will use that money to buy a new certificate each year and implement a secure autoupdater. It's not that much, but I started anyway :smile: Here is the list of donations for full transparency: (three as of Feb 2022)

Thx a lot, its time for a new certificate since the first one is expired :D
